## Our social network is *very* social

So social, in fact, that every single user follows (and is followed) by everyone else!  What a magical social network to be a part of.

**Not everyone is happy though.**

There are grumblings in the Photogram community that users want to *pick and choose* who they follow and therefore who appears in their feed!  It might just be crazy enough to work...

## A Brief History of Following


The model relationships that we're going to discuss in this guide can be tricky to understand at first, just because it brings forward what I found to be an awkward way of thinking.  Join tables.

Sure, *now* it makes sense to me, but I remember feeling quite overwhelmed the first time I was exposed to this idea.

[Check out the Rails Active Record Associations Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html) that runs through some of the associations you'll use often.  Pay special attention to those parts referencing the ```has_many, :through``` relationships because that's what we'll be dealing with today.

Please note that we're also not going to easily be able to *browse* the whole user base in this guide in order to see who we want and don't want to follow.  What we'll do is, list ALL of the posts on Photogram in one dashboard (similar to Instagram's browse feature and exactly what we've been doing up until this point) and have our main news-feed only show the users that we follow.

## Let's Build It!

All talk and no play makes you, the reader, feel not so gay.  So let's go forth and build our functionality.  We can discuss *theory* more as we go.

## Here's How it's Works

At the moment, our user's profiles look like this:

![Current user profile](/content/images/2016/02/userprofiles.png)

We can't actually follow or unfollow a user from here, all we can do is gaze upon their wonderful selfies.

Where the 'Edit Profile' button is in the above screenshot (that's my own profile), we'll put a FOLLOW or FOLLOWING button, depending on our existing relationship.  On clicking the 'FOLLOW' button, we'll use an AJAX call to a ```follow_user``` controller action and the new relationship will be created.  Upon success, we'll use jQuery to transform the 'FOLLOW' button into a green 'FOLLOWING' button (we'll also change the link at this point to point to an ```unfollow_user``` action, just in case).

We'll also adjust our dashboard logic so we're only showing posts from the users we're following and also create a brand new dashboard that emulates our current system of showing EVERYTHING (so we can find new users to follow).

Phew, that's quite a lot to build, let's not waste any more time my friend, greatness awaits.

## First, the Models & Relationships

It's nice to get the models and relationships set up first.  Once these are set up we can easily test relationships in the Rails console that will then convert directly into beautiful logic in our application!

Let's go over what our model relationships will look like:

- A user ```has_many``` users that they're following (those users whose posts will show up on your primary dashboard).
- A user ```has_many``` followers who are also users (the followers will see the users posts on their primary dashboard).

*Easy enough right?*

Sure is!  The complexity is in how you model this data in the background.  Think about it like this.  Imagine we *just* had the user model.  How would we refer to both the following users and the user's followers (think in terms of referencing id's in the database columns)?

You couldn't have a separate column for each relationship, that'd be madness.  That's where a *join* table comes in handy.  The join table simple references a model to another model, or in this case, a model back to itself.  Let's imagine it this way:

There's a record for a user, whose ```id``` is 1.  The user is following users with the id's of 4, 7 and 12.  By creating a separate join table, we can reference a relationship between these users.  The join table can have two columns, ```following_id```, ```follower_id```.

The ```follower_id``` in the above scenario would be 1 for all three records and the ```following_id``` would be 4, 7 and 12 respectively.  Once the relationships are setup nicely in Rails, we could then simply refer to those users we're following with:

```ruby
@current_user.following
```

In the opposite direction, imagine that the user with the ```id``` of 1 is followed by users 2, 3 and 10.  The ```following_id``` is 1 in each of the three records and the ```follower_id``` would be 2, 3, and 10 respectively. To retrieve the records of the user's followers:

```ruby
@current_user.followers
```

If this hasn't sunk in yet, do not fear.  It may take time.  As I've mentioned previously, this sort of relationship made me *quite* uncomfortable for an extended period of time.  Hopefully your brain is better aligned and it'll click for you sooner!  Perservere and you'll be ok in the end I promise.

## Making things happen

Let's generate some migrations for the above relationships.  Jump into your terminal and tap away the following:

```
rails g migration CreateFollowJoinTable
```

Once complete, pop into the migrations folder in your project and open up your newly created file.

What you want to do at this point is to create a table that has two integer columns, one called ```following_id``` and the other called ```follower_id```.  You also want to make sure that both columns have an index and that the combination of both columns in new records MUST be unique.

Call the new table 'follows'.

Give it a go now!  Use your google-foo if you must.

![Your turn!](/content/images/2015/06/YourTurn-1.png)

___

Here's my complete migration file for comparison:

```ruby
class CreateFollowJoinTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table 'follows' do |t|
      t.integer 'following_id', :null => false
      t.integer 'follower_id', :null => false

      t.timestamps null: false
    end

    add_index :follows, :following_id
    add_index :follows, :follower_id
    add_index :follows, [:following_id, :follower_id], unique: true
  end
end

```

Starting from the top, we've called our table 'follows', and the created two integer columns that may not be false.  We add some timestamps for good measure.  Below this, we add an index for model columns and then make sure the combination of the two in a new record must be unique.

Go forth and run the new migration in your terminal:

```
rake db:migrate
```

Perfect!  Give yourself a high-five and once complete, we'll finish of our setup.

First, we want a new model called ```Follow```.  This will reference our ```follows``` table implicitly and will let us create our user relationships.

In the terminal run:

```
rails g model Follow
```

Open up your new ```app/models/follow.rb``` file and edit it thusly:

```ruby
class Follow < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :follower, foreign_key: 'follower_id', class_name: 'User'
  belongs_to :following, foreign_key: 'following_id', class_name: 'User'
end
```

We're explicitly stating our relationships here, rather than the usual Rails way.  We're stating the class that the foreign key is associated with and also giving it name of either 'follower' or 'following'.  Finally, let's adjust our ```User``` model to suit.

Once open, you'll want the new relationships in your user model to look like:


```ruby
  has_many :follower_relationships, foreign_key: :following_id, class_name: 'Follow'
  has_many :followers, through: :follower_relationships, source: :follower

  has_many :following_relationships, foreign_key: :follower_id, class_name: 'Follow'
  has_many :following, through: :following_relationships, source: :following
```

Alright...

Some pretty wild things are happening here so let's go through them.

Our first ```has_many``` line gives us the 'follows' relationship objects where the user is being followed.  The next line goes the next step and accesses a user's ```followers``` *through* those relationships (we're accessing the actual user data at this point).

The second two lines is the same but for the 'following' relationships (those who the user is following, in order to see their posts).

It's one of those things that can be easier to understand by playing around in the console.

Make sure you've saved the above relationships in your ```User``` model and then open up your Rails console.  Let's see how this all works.

*The below assumes you have users with the id of 1, 2 and 3.  If you don't, just use what you have.*

```ruby
# create a new follow relationship where the user 
# with the id of 1 follows the user with the id of 2 
Follow.create(follower_id: 1, following_id: 2)
# create another for good measure with a different user
Follow.create(follower_id: 1, following_id: 3)
# Now, let's create a relationship where the user with 
# the id of 1 is being followed by a user with the 
# id of 3
Follow.create(follower_id: 3, following_id: 1)
# Now, let's see how our relationships work.  First, 
# find the user who we created relationships for.
u = User.find 1
# List this user's followers
u.followers
# List the users this user is following
u.following
# calling follower_relationships on the user will list 
# the relationships we've created in the follows table
# where the user is being followed by other users
u.follower_relationships
# calling following_relationships on the user will list
# the relationships we've created in the follows table 
# where the user is following other users
u.following_relationships
```

If you're anything like me, the words 'following' and 'follower' have lost all meaning at this point and you probably need a coffee.

The point is...

The words and labels aren't important (words and labels are incredibly important in programming, but for the sake of understanding these relationships, it's not), it's how we're *linking* our data that's important.  By creating relationships in the 'follows' table between two users, we can create the schema we need in order to build our functionality.

We can make it even nicer to achieve the creation and destruction of relationships by adding some simple methods to our ```User``` model.  It'd be great if we could simply call ```current_user.follow user_id``` or ```current_user.unfollow user_id``` within our controller. Let's write the simple methods to achieve that now.

```ruby
def follow(user_id)
    following_relationships.create(following_id: user_id)
  end

  def unfollow(user_id)
    following_relationships.find_by(following_id: user_id).destroy
  end
```

## That was some heavy stuff

And I'm sorry. Only time and practice will help you with these concepts.

Let's move on anyway and start building some relationships between our uses within the application itself.

First, let's create a 'follow' button that will sit in our user profiles. Within ```app/views/profiles/show.html.haml```, add our new ```-else``` option:

```haml
  %span
    - if @user == current_user
      = link_to 'Edit Profile', edit_profile_path(@user.user_name),
                                class: 'btn edit-button'
    - else
      = link_to 'Following', unfollow_user_path,
                             remote: true,
                             class: 'btn unfollow-button',
                             id: 'unfollow-button',
                             method: :post
```

This is only temporary, we'll want to show an 'unfollow' button for those users who we're already following, but this will do for the moment (```follow_user_path``` also doesn't exist yet but we'll fix that in a moment as well).

Next, we'll add some styling in our ```app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss``` file:

```scss
.follow-button {
  text-transform: uppercase;
  border-color: #4090db;
  color: #4090db;
  margin-left: 20px;
  &:visited, &:focus, &:hover {
    border-color: #2D6396;
    color: #2D6396;
  }
}

.unfollow-button {
  text-transform: uppercase;
  border-color: #66bd2b;
  background-color: #66bd2b;
  color: white;
  margin-left: 20px;
  &:visited, &:focus, &:hover {
    border-color: #47821F;
    background-color: #47821F;
    color: white;
  }
}

```

Note we added the styling for the 'unfollow' button as well (we'll add it soon enough).

Check it out!

![Follow profile button](/content/images/2016/02/profile-follow-button.png)

Let's make it do something now.

First, we'll need to decide where we want to add the 'follow' and 'unfollow' functionality.  It's tempting to use our existing ```profiles_controller``` but the functionality isn't *really* profile focussed. Let's separate the functionality into its own controller.

```
rails g controller Relationships follow_user unfollow_user
```

We could call this controller 'Following', 'Followers' or so on but relationships seems to make sense.  Feel free to call it what makes sense to you.

Generating the controller with the above command, also creates some new routes for us.  Quickly adjust them now to give them a name and add a reference to the user name of the user we want to follow or unfollow.

```ruby
  post ':user_name/follow_user', to: 'relationships#follow_user', as: :follow_user
  post ':user_name/unfollow_user', to: 'relationships#unfollow_user', as: :unfollow_user
```

Lovely! We've created ourselves a nice looking pair of routes that will do the job perfectly.

Time to add some logic to the ```follow_user``` and ```unfollow_user``` actions in the ```relationships_controller.rb``` file.

You should... give it a go yourself!

Here's how to think about it:

1. First, find the user we want to follow or unfollow via the ```:user_name``` parameter in the url.
2. Create a new relationships between the ```current_user``` and the user we found in step one using our new User methods.
3. If the method call is successful, respond with some javascript that will change the class of the button to 'btn unfollow-button', the text of the button to 'Unfollow' and the link of the button to either 'unfollow\_user' or 'follow\_user' depending on which action you're working on.
4. Go ahead and do the same for the ```unfollow_user``` action.
5. Make sure your profile view is showing the unfollow button for users you already follow and the follow button for users you don't yet follow.

Here's why you can do this yourself:
 
1. You've already implemented something similar to Step One in our previous Profiles article.
2. You've already played with building relationships earlier in this article when we were mucking about in the Rails console.
3. You've responded to saving data with javascript in the Comments AND Likes articles.

Basically, you already know what to do!  Seriously though, give it a go yourself.  The struggle will make you better.  Be better and embrace the struggle.


![Your turn!](/content/images/2015/06/YourTurn-1.png)

___


How'd you go?  Let's compare notes...

Here's my ```RelationshipsController```:

```ruby
class RelationshipsController < ApplicationController
  def follow_user
    @user = User.find_by! user_name: params[:user_name]
    if current_user.follow @user.id
      respond_to do |format|
        format.html { redirect_to root_path }
        format.js
      end
    end
  end

  def unfollow_user
    @user = User.find_by! user_name: params[:user_name]
    if current_user.unfollow @user.id
      respond_to do |format|
        format.html { redirect_to root_path }
        format.js
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Hopefully this makes sense to you at this point.  We find the user who owns the profile and then assign them to the ```@user``` instance variable. If the ```current_user.follow``` method is successful, we then respond with some javascript (our link has the property ```remote: true```).

We pretty much follow the exact same route for the ```unfollow_user``` action but call the ```current_user.unfollow``` method instead.

Now that the controller actions are responding with javascript, we can create those new javascript responses in our ```views/profiles``` folder.

Here's ```follow_user.js.erb```:

```javascript
$('#follow-button').attr('class', 'btn unfollow-button')
                   .text('Following')
                   .attr('href', "/<%= @user.user_name %>/unfollow_user")
                   .attr('id', 'unfollow-button');
```

And here's ```unfollow_user.js.erb```:

```javascript
$('#unfollow-button').text('Follow')
                     .attr('class', 'btn follow-button')
                     .attr('href', "/<%= @user.user_name %>/follow_user")
                     .attr('id', 'follow-button');
```

Last but not least, let's add some logic to our profile view in ```app/views/profiles/show.html.haml```.  Make sure your view looks something like below:

```haml
%span
- if @user == current_user
  = link_to 'Edit Profile', edit_profile_path(@user.user_name),
                            class: 'btn edit-button'
- else
  - if current_user_is_following(current_user.id, @user.id)
    = link_to 'Following', unfollow_user_path,
                           remote: true,
                           class: 'btn unfollow-button',
                           id: 'unfollow-button',
                           method: :post
  - else
    = link_to 'Follow', follow_user_path,
                        remote: true,
                        class: 'btn follow-button',
                        id: 'follow-button',
                        method: :post
```

You'll notice the ```current_user_is_following``` helper method in the view above.  Here's how that could look in your ```profiles_helper.rb``` file:

```ruby
module ProfilesHelper
  def current_user_is_following(current_user_id, followed_user_id)
    relationship = Follow.find_by(follower_id: current_user_id, following_id: followed_user_id)
    return true if relationship
  end
end
```
As of now, you should have a completely functional Follow / Unfollow button that correctly creates and destroys relationships in our application!

Congrats!  If I was there in that room with you I'd give you a high five, followed promptly by a cuddle, followed promptly by our secret handshake.  I love our handshake, especially that little flair at the end.

You know the one.

Let's go forth and adjust our news feed now so it only shows the posts of the users who we follow.

## Selective Selfies

Up until now, we've been seeing ALL of the posts ever created by ALL users on our news feed.  It was a far too social feature of our social network.

If we check out the ```index``` action in our ```PostsController``` we can see why:

```ruby
def index
  @posts = Post.all.order('created_at DESC').page params[:page]
end
```

We're loading ALL of our posts, ordering them and paginating them.  Let's add a scope to our ```Post``` model so we can easily show only the posts for the users we're following.

Open the ```app/models/post.rb``` file and add the following line:

```ruby
scope :of_followed_users, -> (following_users) { where user_id: following_users }
```

This let's us adjust our ```index``` action now:

```ruby
def index
    @posts = Post.of_followed_users(current_user.following).order('created_at DESC').page params[:page]
end
```

Now, go back to your browser and refresh....

![Our Filtered Feed](/content/images/2016/02/Filtered-Feed.png)

We now have a filtered feed!

## Let's find new users to follow

What we'll do to finish this guide is to make sure that our wonderful users can browse ALL other posts (just as they were before) in order to find new and exciting users to follow.

All we'll do is create a new action in our post controller called ```browse```, create a new associated view, and update our navbar to have a link to the browse view.

Go on, give it a go yourself!  Here's a hint, this functionality is EXACTLY what we were doing before!  The only difference is that you're creating a new controller action and a new view. 

Here's one more hint:

The new view and the old index view are going to be *very* similar.  What if we created a new partial view that they could both render?

![Your turn!](/content/images/2015/06/YourTurn-1.png)

___


Create a new partial view called ```_post_dashboard.html.haml```.  Copy over all your haml from your index view into the new view.

```haml
#posts
  = render 'posts'

#paginator.text-center
  = link_to_next_page @posts, 'LOAD MORE', remote: true, id: 'load_more'
```

Now, create a new javascript partial view called ```_post_dashboard.js.erb``` and copy over all of the logic from the ```index.js.erb``` file.

```javascript
$('#posts').append("<%= escape_javascript(render 'posts')%>");
$('#paginator').html("<%= escape_javascript(link_to_next_page(@posts, 'LOAD MORE', remote: true, id: 'load_more'))%>");
if (!$('#load_more').length) { $('#paginator').remove(); }
```

Wonderful!  Now you can delete your old ```index.js.erb``` file and replace your ```index.html.haml``` view with this lonely little line:

```haml
= render 'post_dashboard', posts: @posts
```

So now we've got a new partial and the index view is working just as it was.  Let's add our new browse action & view.

First, create the new action in your ```posts_controller.rb``` file.

```ruby
def browse
  @posts = Post.all.order('created_at DESC').page params[:page]
end
```

That code looks familiar!

Let's now create our new view at ```app/views/posts/browse.html.haml```:

```haml
= render 'post_dashboard', posts: @posts
```

Which also looks familiar...

Let's make sure we have a route for our new view & action.  In your ```routes.rb``` file, add the following line:

```ruby
get 'browse', to: 'posts#browse', as: :browse_posts
```

Last but most certainly not least, let's make it easy for our users to browse all posts.  Let's add it to our ```app/views/layouts/_navbar.html.haml``` view.

```haml
- if user_signed_in?
  %li
    = render 'notifications/notification_dropdown'
  %li
    = link_to "Browse Posts", browse_posts_path
  %li
    = link_to "New Post", new_post_path
  %li
    = link_to "Logout", destroy_user_session_path, method: :delete
- else
   %li
     = link_to "Login", new_user_session_path
   %li
     = link_to "Register", new_user_registration_path
```

Check it out for yourself.  Restart your browser and you should see the feed of ALL of the posts, just as it was back in the old days.

Now let's sit back and reminisce together...


## Homework & the end of an era

There are a few features that would be lovely to have as part of photogram at this point.  Some of them easier, some of them trickier.  You should definitely try to build them all.

- I'd love to have the follower and following counts shown on each profile.  How else can I tell who is popular?

![Profile Counts](/content/images/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-16-at-10-36-48-AM.png)

- I'd love for my own posts to be shown on my dashboard too. How could I achieve that?


That should be enough for the moment.  Once you've done those couple of things, you'll have a pretty well rounded social network on your hands!

This article was the final in the "Let's Build Instagram" series and I hope you've enjoyed the journey thus far. I've certainly enjoyed sharing it with you.

Despite the long breaks, questionable post consistency and occasional errors on my behalf, I've loved every step.
